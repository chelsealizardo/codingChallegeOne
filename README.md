 ###   :sparkles: *She/Her/hers* :sparkles:
<font size=".01">  I am currently a senior undergrad student getting a degree in Geology and Geological Oceanography. I am from Pawtucket, Rhode Island but my family is from tje small carribean country known as Domincan Republic. Before the pandemic, I primarily used my free time travelling, riding my bike around,and hanging out with family and friends. Now I spend alot of time cooking, reading books, listening to podcasts, and working part time at a local grocery store. I have two dogs named Papi and Lucas that live with my mom and sister in Georgia.  </font> 


<font size=".01"> I decided to take NRS 528 this semester because I really enjoy using GIS and hope to someday make a career out of it. I feel as though this class is fit to provide me with a challenge and push me to gain skills within the GIS and computer science disciplines. I hope to learn alot and I especially look forward to learning how to use SQL databases and learn about general data management  in ~~ArcMap~~ Arcpro. </font> 


### :lab_coat: *My research* :lab_coat:
<font size=".01"> I am currently working with Dr. Cardace and the RI NASA Space Grant Consortium to look at Serpentinization and its astrobiological implications especially on Mars. We have been using polished samples from San Juan, PR to analyze and identify vein minerals such as serpentine, magnetite, brucite, chlorite, and gather an understanding of the differences, if there are any, of how the process of serpentinization affects the veins vs. the affects on regular rock. I am also trying to gather a deeper understanding of how the processes that occurred on these samples may reflect processes happening on other planetary bodies such as mars, and what that could mean for the astrobiology of other planetary bodies, which could potentially lead to questions about habitability. </font>

 
 ### :heavy_check_mark: *What i'm Focusing on* :heavy_check_mark:
 <font size=".01"> Currenly I am working towards strengthening my skills in the following areas:
* Learning how to create watershed models.
* Learning how to use GIS without needing a ton of guidance from a professor or mentor.
* Work on making the Geology club more fun and accessible during the pandemic/quarantine (I am the president of the Geology club at the University of Rhode Island).
* Work on keeping myself organized and ahead of my assignments this semester and allow myself adequate tiem to finish everyhting and ask the relevant questions that nee dto be asked in class.
* Broaden my cooking skills to diversify my pallete to make healthy and delicious meals.
