<font size=".01">  I am currently a senior undergrad student getting a degree in Geology and Geological Oceanography. I am from Pawtucket, Rhode Island but my family is from tje small carribean country known as Domincan Republic. Before the pandemic, I primarily used my free time travelling, riding my bike around,and hanging out with family and friends. Now I spend alot of time cooking, reading books, listening to podcasts, and working part time at a local grocery store. I have two dogs named Papi and Lucas that live with my mom and sister in Georgia.  </font> 


<font size=".01"> I decided to take NRS 528 this semester because I really enjoy using GIS and hope to someday make a career out of it. I feel as though this class is fit to provide me with a challenge and push me to gain skills within the GIS and computer science disciplines. I hope to learn alot and I especially look forward to learning how to use SQL databases and learn about general data management  in ~~ArcMap~~ Arcpro. </font>
